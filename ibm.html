        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Reduce the time and cost of maintenance issues in the industrial laundry machine industry by utilizing existing IBM Cloud and Watson IoT capabilities.</p>
        <p><em>This course was a partnership between IBM and the University of Texas (read about it

        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
        <span>Sybil</span>, an IoT system that utilizes IBM Watson's cloud and IoT capabilities, <span>detects washing machine maintenance problems before they happen</span>, saving industrial laundry machine owners thousands of dollars on preventative maintenance issues.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
          Maintenance issues in the industrial laundry machine industry are a costly and draining process. The owners of these industrial laundry facilities are losing valuable time and money when addressing maintenance requests and waiting for machine repairs, leading to overworked employees and frustrated consumers.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We did extensive research on the laundry machine industry, its employees, and how companies currently use IoT technology in their business.
      </p>
      <!-- <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-research-1.jpeg" alt="IBM Cover"> -->
      <!-- <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-research-2.jpg" alt="IBM Cover"> -->
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-research-3.jpeg" alt="white-boarding" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>
        We discovered the use of <span>sensors</span> in standard washing machines; the same sensors that regulate temperature and water levels when the washing machine runs. By connecting machines to the IBM cloud, data from washing machines could be sent to Watson and used to interpret the best next steps for maintenance and improvements.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-sensors.png" alt="sensors" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>
        For example, IBM Watson monitors the condition of a belt in a washing machine at Division Laundry and determines that it is about to snap because the rate of rotation is too high. Watson can then recommend a software update to the laundromat, thus, lengthening the lifespan of the belts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is this important? <span>We can fix problems before they become problems</span>, implement new features easily, and optimize future designs based on real user experiences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interviews</h2>
      <p>
        After doing this initial research, it was time to go out into the field. We targeted dorms, gyms, hotels, and laundromats and spoke to front desk managers and staff about their general pain points when it came to their washing machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our research we discovered some valuable insights: The most costly part of maintenance issues is the potential earnings loss of an unused machine. Because maintenance specialists are scarce, it may take them a few days to a couple of weeks for them to service a request. With multiple machines down, the facility is not running at full efficiency, which can lead to over-worked employees and frustrated customers.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-interview.jpeg" alt="laundromat interview" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>
        “On any given week, I can expect up to four maintenance issues.”
        - Owen the Owner
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than paying for the maintenance service itself, the owner has to pay for gas and a hotel if the specialist is coming from out of town. In many cases, the owner has to pay for two trips: one for the initial diagnoses, and one for installation after the part comes in. This extra trip is extremely costly, and <span>cutting the second trip out of the equation would greatly reduce the owners maintenance expenses.</span>
      </p>
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-interview-2.jpeg" alt="laundromat" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>
        We also discovered that because these maintenance specialists are scarce, the owner usually pays them a good tip, around $300, to maintain a "good relationship" and ensures that they will come again another request is needed. The insights that we gained from our research helped us identify the pain points the owner experiences during these frequent maintenance issues.
      </p>
      <h3>Target Users</h3>
      <p>
        Through our research, we were able to identify our target user - the owners of industrial laundry facilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              Our solution must <span>utilize sensors to predict maintenance needs</span> needs and communicate these needs before a breakdown occurs.
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            Let the owner be able to <span>purchase parts as needed and compare</span> them to other parts on the market.
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            Let the owner be able to <span>easily schedule maintenance requests</span> and <span>effectively communicate</span> the issue to the maintenance specialist
          </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-design-reqs.png" alt="design requirements" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Initial Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        We initially thought the best solution was to create an interface that would allow the owner to monitor his machines, contact maintenance specialists, and order parts from anywhere.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-solution-1.png" alt="interface solution" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-solution-2.png" alt="interface solution" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <img src="./images/ibm/ibm-solution-3.png" alt="interface solution" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>
        <span>Problem:</span> Our solution wasn't addressing a key component of our problem: the relationship and communication between the owner and the maintenance specialist. How the specialist would interact with this tool? We needed to create more than just an interface.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        Our solution tackles predictive maintenance issues that arise frequently in industrial washing machines and <span>fixes the problem before it happens</span>. We want the owner to have complete control of their business and to be able to contact the maintenance specialists as often or as little as they need.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back, for being my first large-scale UX project, I thought my team and I did a great job doing thorough research and creating valuable insights through our findings. One major issue that would have added significantly to the final outcome, is a thorough iteration of our prototype. I found our solution to be creative and answered our stakeholders' issue, however, in reality we also could have been very off from what our user actually needed. Being able to test our ideas with our stakeholders would have been ideal to achieve a better outcome for our users.
