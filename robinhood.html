      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Encourage young adults to engage in the stock market by reduce the fears and anxieties around investing.
      </p>
      <p>Assignment Criteria: Improve an existing financial app design by utilizing artificial intelligence.</p>
      <h2>
          Outcome
      </h2>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
        Enhancing the design of the popular investment app, Robinhood, by creating a dynamic, personalized UI that allows users to easily learn about stock trading and continually grow into a more experienced investor.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Few young adults are investing their money in the stock market, missing out on a great opportunity to grow their wealth for the future.</p>
      <p>Robinhood is a stock-trading app that allows users to buy and sell stocks with no transaction fees, research stocks using a live stream of recent articles, and track important metrics. It has become increasingly popular among Millennials because of its sleek and simple UI.​​​​​​​</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Millennials don't trust the stock market. According to Merrill Edge Report, two-thirds of wealthy Millennials are more reliant on their savings account than investments for future financial security.</p>
      <p>"So rather than put their hard-earned savings into the stock market, these wealthy young people are hoarding the funds in barely-no-interest savings accounts." -Merrill Edge Report</p>
      <p>Millennials have witnessed the impact of the Great Recession their parents and grandparents suffered through, and adopted the view that the stock market can't be trusted for financial security.</p>

      <h3>Target Users</h3>
      <p>Building off of Robinhood's existing user-base, we decided we wanted to appeal to users with the following characteristics:​​​​​​​</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Independent, driven adults with a disposable income</li>
        <li>Interested in active, hands-on investing</li>
        <li>Intimidated by the stock market, but wanting to learn</li>
        <li>Technologically literate (comfortable using a mobile application)</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="./images/robinhood/robinhood-comp-analysis.png" alt="Robinhood Competitive Analysis" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>Robinhood has become increasingly popular among Millennials because of its sleek and simple UI, compared to traditional investment apps like Vanguard, Fidelity, and AmeriTrade. Traditional investment apps are over-complex and make investing seem daunting.</p>
      <p>Acorns is on the opposite end of the spectrum; an app that allows users to put in money and it automatically invests it for you. Acorns is completely hands-off and doesn't educate the user on how to intelligently invest their money.</p>

      <img src="./images/robinhood/robinhood-comp-analysis-2.png" alt="Robinhood Competitive Analysis" style="padding-bottom:30px;max-width:400px;">

      <p>While Robinhood's seemed like the perfect balance between Acorns and traditional investing apps, it actually fell more on the "over-simplified" side. Through testing, we discovered it also lacked to educate its users on how to make informative financial decisions, despite having a simplified UI.</p>
      <p><span>Robinhood is oversimplified, rather than clarified.</span></p>
      <p>Robinhood enables people to invest, but not to understand the logic behind a good financial decision. The app aims to encourage the purchase of stocks rather than fully educate its users about the world of investment.</p>

      <h2>Design Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Provide different <span>degrees of assistance</span> by adapting to skill level and investing interests</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Provide more <span>educational resources</span> and opportunities for the user to increase their fluency in investing</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Allow users to have an <span>active role in learning</span>, making it more hands-on, but less confusing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      <p>Adaptive guidance will allow us to create a personalized, dynamic user interface, allowing us to lower the barrier between hands-off investment and intimidating, confusing financial trading tools for our users. This more personalized experience aids users to grow and adapt to their increasing knowledge of stock trading.</p>

      <section>
        <p><span>Solution #1:</span> To help beginning investors nativigate confusing terms, our solution <span>highlights and defines key investing terms</span> in the app. The user can click on the highlighted circle next to terms and easily read the definition of the term that pops up.</p>
        <img src="./images/robinhood/robinhood-final-1.png" alt="Robinhood Final Solution" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        <p>For novice investors, the AI will highlight important key words for beginners. As the user continues to use the app, the app will start to expand on more niche, complex terms. This enhancement decreases the overwhelming feeling of "trying to learn everything" in the beginning of the investment journey.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p><span>Solution #2:</span> An added News Tab navigable from the Home Page that consolidates a collection of trusted news articles based off a users interests and investing behavior.</p>
        <img src="./images/robinhood/robinhood-final-2.png" alt="Robinhood Final Solution" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        <p>Novice investors would be presented with investing basics, while slowly advancing to more complex articles as the user becomes more advanced. This enhancement helps further the user's investing understanding in topics that interest them.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p><span>Solution #3:</span> A personalized and dynamic home page that displays visual data based off of the user's investment interests and activity. Content becomes more detailed and complex as the user becomes more experienced.</p>
        <img src="./images/robinhood/robinhood-final-3.png" alt="Robinhood Final Solution" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        <p>The Home Page is unique to each user, presenting data and visuals based on the users interested and investment activity. For example, if a user is a frequent investor in international stocks, their Home Page may feature global equity performance and international markets.</p>
