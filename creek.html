        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          How might we improve the area around Waller Creek to enhance the student experience at the University of Texas?
        </p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
          The Oasis, the Nook, and the Perch; 3 distinct outdoor spaces surrounding Waller Creek with the goal of combining nature, mental-wellness, and community for UT students.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Waller Creek is the only natural body of water on the University of Texas campus. Despite its natural beauty and uniqueness, the university has often treated Waller Creek as something to be “dealt with.” From the student perspective, the creek is overlooked and ignored because of the uneven paths, overgrown greenery and polluted environment. This has not always been the case.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-intro.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

      <p>In 1969, there was a notorious student protest at the University of Texas known as the Battle of Waller Creek. The students were protesting the removal of 39 centuries-old live oak trees to make room for the expansion of the Darrell K. Royal football stadium.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-battle-2.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>Students from many disciplines at the university advocated for Waller Creek and combined their talents in an attempt to save the trees and halt the stadium expansion. The news of the Battle of Waller Creek made headlines all around the nation and the globe.</p>
      <p>Today, Waller Creek is largely overlooked and neglected. As a new wave of interdisciplinary students at the University of Texas, we want to bring a student's attention, pride, and advocacy back to the creek.</p>

      <h4>Project Scope</h4>
      <p>For the scope of our project, we focused on the section of Waller Creek that runs through campus from 23rd Street to 25th Street. We focused our efforts on the area with the highest student traffic on campus.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-map-1.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Research</h2>

      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>We talked to six experts for more context on the how the creek is being used in professional work and hear how they’re providing learning opportunities for students revolving Waller Creek.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-experts.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>We also talked to students across campus to learn as much as possible on how they experience Waller Creek, as well as learn about student life on campus.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-students.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

      <h4>Key Findings</h4>

      <p><span>Theme #1: The benefits of urban nature</span>. This idea was supported by every expert that we interviewed. Some of the benefits of Waller Creek include that it allows a moment of rest with all the busy surroundings of campus. It allows people to appreciate the beauty in a natural feature that is often overlooked - a creek advocate, Kevin Anderson, said “[The appeal of the creek is that there is] privacy in the midst of this crazy campus… a moment of quiet escape.”</p>

      <img src="./images/creek/creek-interviews-2.jpg" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

      <p><span>Theme #2: Stressors of university life</span>. Our second major theme was stressors of college which ties back to students. They’ve rarely been experiencing the benefits of urban nature through Waller Creek. Farheen a business transfer student said “When I came to UT, I realized how competitive it really is and I lost all drive. I always talk to my friends about how stressful college is when it really isn't supposed to be.”</p>
      <p>Another student, Hana, said "[Ideas of success] are huge stressors and means of competition for our generation; I don't think it's a healthy stressor." While the benefits of urban nature have been highlighted by the experts we talked to, Waller Creek is not the place of rejuvenation it might or could be for students as it is from our experts’ perspectives.</p>

      <img src="./images/creek/creek-interviews.jpg" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

      <p><span>Theme #3: Unfulfilled student needs on campus</span>. There is a lack of necessary relaxation spaces on campus, given that students are experiencing stressors of college. We affirmed a need for more intentional spaces for students to relax and take mental breaks from both experts and students. Director of Sustainability at UT, Jim Walker mentioned that “UT doesn’t have a lot of intentional spaces for students to get a mental break.”</p>
      <p>A student, Allie, told us “I don’t have a favorite place to relax on campus, but if I had to choose it would be looking out of a window in McCombs.”</p>

      <h3>Perspectives Board</h3>
      <p>To get more voices about the student perspective, we asked students to post sticky notes on an opinion board that asked questions such as “What do you do when you have free time on campus” or “What do you think of when you remember your time at UT.” We received over 500 individual responses from students about their feelings and experiences in college.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-board.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

      <h4>Key Findings</h4>
      <p>When we went over the responses, we noticed that students don’t interact much with nature on campus, and were startled by the amount of responses that expressed negative wellbeing such as high levels of stress, loneliness. With further research, we discovered the need for better mental well-being on campus.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-results.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;max-width:600px;">

      <h4>Research on Mental Health</h4>
      <p>In an article by our student newspaper last month, the Counseling and Mental Health Center at UT notes an increased demand for their services due to students experiencing anxiety and stress at an all-time high. “The demand for counseling and mental services has increased 77% over the last 8 years.”</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-cmhc.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;max-width:500px;">
      <p>In a 2017 survey by the American College Health Association, students reported that anxiety and stress negatively affects their academic performance. 42% of participants felt so overwhelmed that it was difficult to function, making it hard to succeed academically.</p>
      <p>However, studies show a <span>positive correlation between nature and wellbeing</span>. The World Health Organization reports that “Green spaces are important to mental health”. ‘Green space’, including urban parks and street greenery, benefit mental wellbeing by improving mood and concentration while decreasing stress and anxiety.</p>
      <p>If even small interactions with nature like noticing a dandelion in a crack in the sidewalk or a tree at bus stop promotes positive wellbeing, then <span>how might we utilize Waller Creek as UT’s largest natural resource to improve student wellness?</span></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Sensemaking</h2>
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>Through our extensive research from experts, students, and secondary sources, we created 3 insights that summarized our research findings. We referred back to these insights frequently during our ideation stage to make sure our solutions were backed up by our research.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-sensemaking.jpg" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;max-width:400px;">
      <p><span>Insight #1: </span>Students are exposed to high levels of stress, and spending time in nature benefits mental wellness in a proactive way.</p>
      <p><span>Insight #2: </span>Nature provides convenient moments of relief in urban settings.</p>
      <p><span>Insight #3: </span>UT students exhibit a need for a rejuvenating space. Some students require only a moment of delight, while others desire a more immersive experience.</p>

      <h3>Archetype Map</h3>
      <p>In addition to in-depth interviews from students, we also intercepted students around campus and asked them questions about the creek. To summarize our findings, we created an archetype map based on students <span>attitude</span> and <span>awareness</span> of the creek. By laying out our finding, we started to notice some clear trends appear.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-arch.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>Most students fell into the “neutral” category. However, we found that once we took students down to the creek, they were automatically optimistic about the creek’s potential. <span>Even the “unfamiliar” and the “unopinionated” students started to imagine the possibilities of the space</span>.</p>
      <p>The students of the 60s were creek advocates. Maybe the difference between them and the apathetic students of today, is that they lack a reason to care.</p>

      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>We created personas based on the students we interviewed, and used archetype map to help identify our target users.</p>
      <p>Passerby Paul is an accounting junior who spends most of his time in McCombs. He parks in the San Jacinto garage, which is near the creek. He walks over the creek every day on his way to and from class, but he doesn’t even know it’s there. Paul is the <span>"Unfamiliar,” complete unaware and therefor neutral about Waller Creek</span>.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-persona-1.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>Hang-Out Haley is a studio art freshman who spends a lot of time on campus, in her dorm or in class. She knows the creek is near the art building, so she sees it every day, but it doesn’t look welcoming to her. Haley is the <span>"Unopinionated,” aware of the creek, but neutral about it</span>.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-persona-2.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p><span>“Neutral” Students like Paul and Haley are our target users</span>. We want to help them gain awareness for the creek by showing them it’s something that can benefit them.</p>

      <h3>Revised Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>Based on our personas, and what we learned about mental wellness from our research, we narrowed down and revised our problem statement.</p>
      <h4><span>How might Waller Creek become a mental wellness resource to help Paul and Haley manage their stress?</span></h4>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Before jumping into out final solution, we tested our ideas with actual UT students. We created 3 different prototypes (one per week), around the same area. Each prototype had a unique goal, and tested a different idea and concept relating back to our insights.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-map-2.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>We wanted an area with enough traffic that was <span>convenient</span> for someone like Paul to enjoy, but also a place with <span>enough space and with a peaceful environment</span> for someone like Haley to spend time. We discovered that the quiet, open space just North of 24th street would be the perfect home to test out our ideas.</p>

      <p><span>Prototype #1: Pop Up Violin Concert</span>. Our goal was to create an engaging experience targeting students passing by, by bringing live music to their daily commute.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-prototype-1.jpg" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>From this prototype, we learned that <span>a less formal event attracts more students and allows students to interact with the event in whatever way they felt most comfortable</span> - whether that was sitting, standing or even just slowing down on their way to class. However, the level of interaction was brief and the long-term effect on students is minimal.</p>

      <p><span>Prototype #2: Community Garden</span>. Our goal was to create an experience that students like Haley would feel comfortable frequently come back to - by providing an opportunity for students to spend quality time interacting with nature.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-prototype-2.jpg" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>From this prototype, we saw that students actively participated in planting seeds - and concluded that when given the opportunity - <span>students genuinely do want to spend time in nature to improve their mental well-being</span>. However, how could we design a space that was informative by itself, without requiring a staff?</p>

      <p><span>Prototype #3: Campus Retreat</span>. Our third prototype was a casual creek retreat where students could design their own waller creek experience. Our goal was to learn what kind of space would encourage students to come back even without a formal invitation - by seeing how students envisioned the future of this space.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-prototype-3.jpg" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>From this prototype, we found that <span>students were more interested in things that create a relaxing environment</span> - like hammocks and comfortable seating, <span>rather than a high-activity environment</span> - like yard games, or things that they found less purposeful - like public art. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design Principles</h2>
      <p>Through our research, we found many consistencies with both students and experts. We wanted to solidify these motifs and create a set of design principles to stick to while finalizing our proposal.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-design-req.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>With these in mind, we wanted to suggest three big concepts for the future of the spaces surrounding the waller creek.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      <p>We believe UT can be at the forefront of this nature and mental wellness movement as it continues to grow. We wanted to create an area on campus where students can conveniently enjoy the benefits of Waller Creek, the largest natural resource surrounding UT students. We proposed <span>3 outdoor spaces, each with a specific goal</span> for the unique needs of the students at the University of Texas.</p>

      <h3>Proposal 1</h3>
      <p>Our prototype suggests that our gardening activity lent to the most interaction and positive feedback from students. Student would come back to check on their plants without an informed invitation to do so. We also found that this kind of habit-building is one of the most impactful ways to benefit mental wellness and create a sense of accomplishment in small ways.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-solution-oasis-2.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>Additionally, in our interactive student perspectives board, many students expressed a longing for community on campus. This space would be an area that fosters a sense of community, where students can interact with each other freely. We hope the garden makes a pleasant conversation starter aside from just being a relaxing amenity.</p>

      <h3>Proposal 2</h3>
      <p>Students are exposed to high levels of stress during their time at university. However, even while students are working, we can still make their learning and studying environment better by creating a peaceful and comfortable environment outdoors. </p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-solution-nook-2.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>Spending time in nature benefits mental wellness in a proactive way, and through our prototypes, we found that students prefer to study outside rather than inside. For the optimal study environment, students expressed the desire for outlets, shade, and comfortable workspaces. We also wanted to make sure we included group workings spaces, again touching on creating a sense of community.</p>

      <h3>Proposal 3</h3>
      <p>UT students exhibit a need for a rejuvenating space – some require only a moment of delight while others desire a more immersive experience.</p>
      <img src="./images/creek/creek-solution-perch-2.png" alt="waller creek mockup" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>At the Perch, students who don’t necessarily have time to spend too much time near the creek can still feel that their day has been improved by just walking past a beautifully curated area. Of course, those who do choose to spend time in it can benefit from private meditation spaces, relaxing swing structures, and a zen-like maze where students can simply escape however they may need to.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>All three of these spaces call back to our insights and benefits both those who want to spend more time in nature as well as those who simply pass by. Students are exposed to high levels of stress, and spending time in nature benefits mental wellness in a proactive way. This is especially needed in today’s increasingly urban settings at the University of Texas.</p>
      <p><span>These spaces are not mutually exclusive</span>, nor meant to be used as blueprints. They are simply guiding ideas that speak to what we’ve discovered students want and need on campus.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, Waller Creek has long missed student attention. Our solution fully uses this beautiful natural resource to provide for students, while also helping students engage and bring awareness to the creek.</p>
